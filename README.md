# Fynd_Dashboard
This project is a web-based AI feedback system built using FastAPI, Jinja2 templates, and Google Gemini AI, designed to collect, process, and analyze user feedback in real-time. It features two dashboards: one for users and one for administrators, all reading and writing from a shared persistent data source.
